# Widgets

HexUN-UIUX sets a structure for UI elements. In the end, it's a simple pattern that is recreatable. 

The widgets provided in this folder are implementations of common widgets. These are just suggestions to speed things up. 

## Categories

### Containers
Containers are expected to hold other elements, but do not directly interact with them. Normally used for layout.

### Panels
Panels manage a grouping of other elements and provide a facade for interacting with them as a group. 

### Monitors
Show data only.

### Controls
Provide interaction to the user in the interface
